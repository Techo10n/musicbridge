Music App Playlist Sharer

- Input a link to a playlist from any music app (YT Music, Apple Music, Spotify, etc.)
- Output a link to the same playlist on a different (user-selected) music app
- Ignore songs that aren’t available on the destination app
- Automatically set destination playlist to “shareable” (unlisted on yt music, etc.)
